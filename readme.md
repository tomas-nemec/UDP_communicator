# UDP communicator
Main idea of this project was to create own UDP 
communicator which will allow users send messages 
or files through the LAN.

### Designing own protocol
- uses 2-way handshake
for establishing the connection
- RST for terminating the connection  
- sending ACK after each packet
### Protocol header
